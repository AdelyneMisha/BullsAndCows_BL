# BullsAndCows_BL
Beginner's League challenge : Bulls and Cows


Create a four digit random number from the digits 1 to 9, without duplication. The program should: *Ask for guesses to this number. *Reject guesses that are malformed. *Print the score for the guess. The score is computed as: (1)The player wins if the guess is the same as the randomly chosen number, and the program ends. (2)A score of one bull is accumulated for each digit in the guess that equals the corresponding digit in the randomly chosen initial number. (3)A score of one cow is accumulated for each digit in the guess that also appears in the randomly chosen number, but in the wrong position.

I have used python to build this CLI based game
